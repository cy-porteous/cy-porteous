### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Cy

I'm a passionate web developer who recently graduated from a Le Wagon London's intensive Web Dev bootcamp. My journey in the world of tech started with a curiosity and a desire to learn to code, post boot camp I'm fully committed to web development and especially like building websites & apps that offer value.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently sharpening my skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and exploring coding challenges on Codewars. 
- ðŸš€ I believe in the power of continuous learning and strive to be a better version of my self every day.
